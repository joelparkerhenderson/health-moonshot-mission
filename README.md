# Health moonshot mission

I'm seeking ideas and inspirations for a health moonshot mission.

I'm seeking your help and advice toward choosing a great one.

This writeup aims to get a wide range of stakeholders up to speed on context and options.

## What is a moonshot mission?

The term "moonshot mission" refers to audacious, long-term projects aiming for radical solutions to massive challenges. The term is inspired by the 1960s Apollo program to fly a person to the moon.

- A great moonshot mission provides a massive motivator for teams working together toward a common goal that superbly visible and foundationally inspirational.

- Examples of moonshot missions: The Human Genome Project mapped the entire human genome. Waymo is developing driverless cars to solve transportation safety.

Key characteristics:

- Multiplier Thinking: Aiming for 2x+ improvement, not 20%+ improvement.

- Radical Solution: Utilizing disruptive technology to tackle a massive problem.

- High Risk/High Reward: Acknowledges the possibility of failure while aiming for a potentially society-altering impact.

What makes a great moonshot mission?

- A great moonshot mission is specific and actionable by teams; it can't be merely vague or nebulous such as "cure cancer" or "childhood wellness".

- A great moonshot mission is uplifting and inspirational for many people; it can't be merely routine or reductive such as "decrease clinic waiting times by 20%" or "cost savings by switching from paper letters to text messages".

- A great moonshot mission leads to progress in many related areas and into the future; it can't be so scoped or limited such as "pay nurses more money" or "a patient can view their own medical records".

## Moonshot areas

Large health systems have many health and care areas where we could explore potential moonshot missions. Here are some broad areas that I've gathered together by talking with medical professionals, public health researchers, and colleagues.

The top four broad categories can be summarized as cancer-related, elderly-related, heart-related, and self-care related.

### Example cancer-related area

We know we want to improve cancer treatment pathways. One way is to diagnose earlier. One way to do that is to aim for genetic-oriented cancers and do early testing of genetic descendets.

For example, one kind of area is Lynch syndrome, which is an inherited genetic condition that significantly increases the lifetime risk of developing colorectal, endometrial (uterine), ovarian, and other cancers, often at a younger age.

- Lynch syndrome is caused by mutations in DNA repair genes, this condition affects an estimated 1 in 279 people, with many cases undiagnosed.

- Lynch syndrome boosts cancer risk, but early screening and management can lead to a normal life expectancy.

QUESTIONS:

- How big a problem is this area?

- If you're generally familiar with this area, can you comment on this, such as what's happening, if there's relevant work in progress, or any good introductions to read and learn?

### Example age-related area

We know we have many elderly people who slip and fall, causing hip injuries that are painful, and make subsequent falls more likely. This type of injury is increasing in our country due to an aging population.

For example, one kind of age-related area is "bed blockers".

- Slip-and-fall treatment can require an extended stay in hospital, such as when there isn't an available outpatient care facility, or carer professional, or family member to help.

The follow-on complication is the hospital overstay will "bed block" meaning stop the admission of other patients, even ones with more-severe more-urgent injuries.

- This in turn causes problems when ambulances arrive at hospitals but cannot move their patients into the hospital because of lack of space or lack of beds or lack of cares.

QUESTIONS:

- How big a problem is this area?

- If you're generally familiar with this area, can you comment on this, such as what's happening, if there's relevant work in progress, or any good introductions to read and learn?

### Example heart-related area

We know we have many middle-aged people who have heart disease, which in turn causes emergency admissions, heart attacks, and sometimes sudden death.

For example, one kind of heart-related area is atrial fibrillation (AFib). This is a common, often chronic arrhythmia causing a rapid, irregular heartbeat when the heart's upper chambers (atria) quiver instead of contracting effectively.

- Symptoms include heart palpitations, fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Major complications include stroke, heart failure, and blood clots.

- Triggers are faulty electrical signals in the heart, often stemming from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart valve problems, thyroid issues, or excessive alcohol intake.

QUESTIONS:

- How big a problem is this area?

- If you're generally familiar with this area, can you comment on this, such as what's happening, if there's relevant work in progress, or any good introductions to read and learn?

### Example self-care-related area

We know we have many people doing their own self-care.

Self-care devices:

- A person uses a smartwatch or smartphone to track their workouts, heartbeats, sleep quality, etc.

- There are many more kinds of devices in play, such as smart scales to track weight, smart exercise machines to track gym visits, smart toothbrushes to track oral wellness, and more.

Self-care AI:

- A person uses ChatGPT to ask about health symptoms, or Claude to review their existing medical records, or Mistral to ask about nutrition meal planning, etc.

- The AI area is improving extremely rapidly, even month-by-month, and shows no signs of slowing down.

Self-care diagnostics:

- Any competent adult can go to a convenient pharmacy, either in person or online, and easily order many kinds of health tests.

- Some examples of popular self-care test types are home finger-prick blood tests, home gut microbiome tests, home allergy tests, home nutrition tests such as for iron or vitamin D, STI tests, and more.

Self-care treatments:

- Some examples of popular self-care treatments are elimination diets, Traditional Chinese Medicine, CBD for treating anxiety, GPL semaglutide/tirzepatide via pay-private websites, and more.

- Doctors are often recommending self-care treatments that go beyond medical practices. For example, doctors are recommending elderly people try yoga and Tai Chi for improving balance, and recommending that people who are overweight go to the gym and start daily walks.

QUESTIONS:

- How big a problem/effect/change is this area?

- If you're generally familiar with this area, can you comment on this, such as what's happening, if there's relevant work in progress, or any good introductions to read and learn?

## NHS England moonshot mission for obesity

NHS England has published its moonshot mission, which is to tackle obesity. The information in this section is thanks to the NHS England website.

The NHS 10-Year Health Plan includes an ambitious "moonshot" to end the obesity epidemic, targeting a shift from treatment to prevention. It focuses on banning energy drink sales to children, restricting junk food ads, and introducing mandatory healthy food sales targets for large companies. It also aims to expand access to weight-loss injections.

Key components of the 10-year strategy, as reported in 2025/2026, include:

- Prevention Measures: Restricting junk food advertising, limiting new hot food takeaway outlets, and strengthening school food standards.

- Food Industry Action: Mandating healthy food sales reporting for large companies to set new, stricter nutritional targets.

- Treatment Expansion: Doubling access to the NHS Digital Weight Management Programme.

- Weight-Loss Jabs: Rolling out medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro as part of a holistic, supported weight management pathway.

- Structural Support: Restoring the value of the Healthy Start scheme and expanding free school meals for families on Universal Credit.

The initiative aims to address the high costs of obesity, which affects about 64% of adults in England, with nearly 30% categorized as obese. Despite the ambitious targets, some reports indicate initial challenges in local access to medication and services.

## But moonshot mission for obesity is not fun

When I talk with clinical providers, most agree that obesity is the #1 important health issue overall, because it causes follow-on effects for many other diseases (e.g. heart disease) and problems (e.g. poor nutrition) and accidents (e.g. slip-and-fall is harder).

However-- in my opinion, obesity is a bad title for a moonshot mission because it's not fun, not inspirational to most people, and has such a long track record of failures in so many settings worldwide. Most people don't like talking about obesity, don't like thinking about it, and don't like the stigma of it.

Worse-- the mission is self-defeating, both personally (i.e. when a person loses weight, then they're no longer in the mission) and industry-financially (i.e. when government bans snacks, then snack companies fight back).

## How about Heart Health?

Given all the above, how about "Heart Health" as a moonshot mission idea?

- Heart Health aligns extermely well with the heart disease issue, plus is more fun to talk about.

- Heart Health aligns extermely well with the self-care area, because heart tracking is currently available on many consumer devices, including most smartwatches (e.g. heart rate and more measures are available on Apple Watch, Google Watch, Samsung Watch, all with price points near ~$300) and on widespread NHS-approved heart-specific lower-cost devices (e.g. KardiaMobile ECG for ~$100).

- Heart Health has excellent branding-- which greatly helps moonshot missions-- because branding can be based on big red heart, which worldwide is frequently associated with health overall, as well as with fitness tracking.

- Heart Health is highly aligned with the NHS England moonshot mission to lower obesity, plus isn't entangled with bans on snacks or similar industry regulations.

- Heart Health has many paths to success, such as exercise, better nutrition, better sleep, and even medical treatment paths such as GLP drugs.

- Heart Health has a specific metric called Heart Rate Variability (HRV) which studies show is an excellent top-level key performance indicator of total wellness. Having one key performance indictor helps a moonshot mission succeed.

- Heart Health metrics can lead easily to two closely-related key performance indicators: body mass index (BMI) and sleep quality index (SQI). There are literally hundreds of consumer offerings to help improve body mass index (e.g. smart scales that display BMI) and sleep quality index (e.g. sleep apnea detection apps). Similarly, Heart Health can lead easily to wider aspects such as nutrition improvements, nutrition-related diagnostic tests, cholesterol-lowering treaments, and much more.
